TreeStat2
=========

Software for producing statistics on phylogenetic trees. 
The scope of TreeStat2 is the processing into statistics of: 
  (1) Time-trees 
  (2) Sampled-ancestor trees and 
  (3) Structured (multi-type) time-trees.
  
This package depends on [BEAST2](https://github.com/CompEvol/beast2/) see also [https://beast2.org/](https://beast2.org/)

## Example Usage

Below are some example commands. For a full list of options, run:

```bash
applauncher TreeStatApp --help
```

> [!Note]
> Depending on your installation, you may need to use the full path to applauncher.
> For example:
> `Applications/BEAST 2.7.7/bin/applauncher`

### Compute One Statistic for a Single Tree File

To compute the `TreeLength` statistic for `example.trees` and save the result to `computed-stats.log`:

```bash
applauncher TreeStatApp --stats TreeLength --tree-file example.trees --out-file computed-stats.log
```

---

### Compute Multiple Statistics for Multiple Tree Files

To compute both `TreeLength` and `CCD1ExpectedRFDistance` for two input files 
(`example1.trees` and `example2.trees`) and save the output to tagged log files:

```bash
applauncher TreeStatApp --stats TreeLength CCD1ExpectedRFDistance --tree-files example1.trees example2.trees --out-tag -stats.log
```

This will generate:
- `example1-stats.log`
- `example2-stats.log`

If no `--out-tag` is specified, the default suffix `-treestats.log` is used. For example:

```bash
applauncher TreeStatApp --stats TreeLength CCD1ExpectedRFDistance --tree-files example1.trees example2.trees
```

Generates:
- `example1-treestats.log`
- `example2-treestats.log`

---

### Using a Control File Instead of Command-Line Stats

You can also define the statistics in a plain text control file. For example, create a file named `config`:

```
TreeLength
CCD1ExpectedRFDistance
```

Then run:

```bash
applauncher TreeStatApp --control-file config --tree-files example1.trees example2.trees --out-tag -stats.log
```

This will also generate:
- `example1-stats.log`
- `example2-stats.log`


### Further Input Options

In addition to the shorthand statistic names (e.g., `TreeLength`, `CCD1ExpectedRFDistance`),
you may also specify the **fully qualified class names** directly in a file `config`:

```
treestat2.statistics.TreeLength
treestat2.statistics.CCD1ExpectedRFDistance
```

or on the command line 

```bash
applauncher TreeStatApp --stats treestat2.statistics.TreeLength  treestat2.statistics.CCD1ExpectedRFDistance --tree-files example.trees
```

> [!Important]
> This is exactly how shorthand names are resolved internally.
> 
> Specifying the full class path allows TreeStat to use statistics from other packages or custom implementations 
> â€” as long as they follow the expected `TreeSummaryStatistic` interface.
> 
> This feature is currently **experimental and untested**!
